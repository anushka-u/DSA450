An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.

Examples :

Input: -12, 11, -13, -5, 6, -7, 5, -3, -6
Output: -12 -13 -5 -7 -3 -6 11 6 5

Three ways to solve this question:
Sort the array _ TC : O(nlogn) using Merge sort
Partition method
The optimized one is to choose a low and high
set low =0
high = n-1
increase low if arr[low]<0
decrease high if arr[high]>0
swap arr[low] and arr[high] if arr[low]>0 and arr[high]<0 and increase low, decrease high
Time Complexity will be O(n).
