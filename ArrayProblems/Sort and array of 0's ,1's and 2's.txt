Given an array of size N containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s; sort the array in ascending order.


Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
arr[]= {0 2 1 2 0}
Output:
0 0 1 2 2
Explanation:
0s 1s and 2s are segregated
into ascending order.

Soln : Two approach-
1. Sort the array using our traditional sorting way ot merge sort
The only issue will be Time complexity that will be in our traditional case is O(n^2)
and in merge sort it will be O(nlogn)

2. Or We could Use DNF algorithm which is short form of Dutch National flag algo
Algorithm:
1. set three variable low, mid and high where low and mid should point at start of array and high
at end of array
2 if arr[mid] 0, swap arr[low] and arr[mid] and increase both low and mid by 1.
3. If arr[mid]==1, Increase value of mid by 1
4. If arr[mid]==2, swap arr[mid] and arr[high] and decrease value of high by 1

TC will be O(n).
