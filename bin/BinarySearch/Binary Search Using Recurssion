Apply Binary search in array using recurssion
=> Algorithm:
1- To apply binary search in array, Array must be sorted
 set a low ==> low =0;
 set a high ==> high = sizeOfArray-1;
 set a mid ==> mid = low+(high-low) /2;

now check if (arr[mid]>key)
set high = mid -1;

if(arr[mid] <key)
set low = mid +1;

if(low>high) =>terminate (base condition)
